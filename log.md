# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 8, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I prepared the GitHub repo for the challenge.

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling nervous... I hope I'm able to complete the challenge.

### Day 1: January 9, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the JSON APIs and Ajax section of freeCodeCamp. I also started laying down the foundation for the random quote generator project.

**Thoughts:** I understand the basics of JSON but I'm still confused about how to implement APIs.

### Day 2: January 10, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I continued to work on the random quote generator project. I refreshed my memory of Javascript key object pairs by reading chapter 4 of Eloquent Javascript and watching some YouTube videos.

**Thoughts:** I still need to  refresh more of my Javascript knowledge.

### Day 3: January 11, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I continued to work on the random quote generator project. I watched a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJesac0_Ftw) on JSON and AJAX, which was very helpful. I was able to implement the JS code to display a random quote from the array of JS objects.

**Thoughts:** I am happy with today's progress.

### Day 4: January 12, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I continued to work on the random quote generator project. I cleaned up my JS code and read the [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/web/tweet-button/parameters) in order to tweet the random quote.

**Thoughts:** I am happy with today's progress.

### Day 5: January 13, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I am more than halfway done with the random quote generator project. Yay! I added a JSON file on gitHub with a list of quotes and authors. Then I also read the [documentation for .getJSON()](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/) and watched some YouTube videos on how to use JSON with jQuery.

**Thoughts:** I learned a lot today.

### Day 6: January 14, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I improved the generator by preventing it from showing the same quote twice in a row. I also changed the placement of the Tweet button and the "get new quote" button.

**Thoughts:** Today was frustrating because of the debugging (it turned out that I forgot to capitalize a letter).

### Day 8: January 16, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I started on FreeCodeCamp's weather app project. I hit a roadblock because of the API's incompatibility with HTTPS.  

**Thoughts:**  I'm annoyed.

### Day 9: January 17, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I continued to work on the weather app. I found a new weather API that supports HTTPS and was able to use it successfully on the app.  

**Thoughts:**  I am happy with today's progress.

### Day 11: January 19, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the weather app and started doing research on the Wikipedia viewer. 

**Thoughts:**  At a later date, I might go back and improve the weather app's UI.

### Day 12: January 20, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Wikipedia project from FreeCodeCamp. I used Bootstrap to set up the basic layout. Then I read up on the Wikipedia API documents.

**Thoughts:**  I really wanted to skip work today but I'm glad I didn't.

### Day 13: January 21, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I continued to research the Wikipedia API functionality and managed to write code that retrieves a random Wikipedia article URL.

**Thoughts:**  I've realized how difficult it is to read documentation for an API that has so much functionality. Google is a life saver.

### Day 14: January 22, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I completed the portion of the app that retrieves a random Wikipedia article. 

**Thoughts:**  The MediaWiki API is kinda confusing.

### Day 15: January 23, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the code that displays the search results.  

**Thoughts:**  The search doesn't handle non-alphnumeric characters. I need to find a fix for that.
