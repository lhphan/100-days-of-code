# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 8, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I prepared the GitHub repo for the challenge.

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling nervous... I hope I'm able to complete the challenge.

### Day 1: January 9, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the JSON APIs and Ajax section of freeCodeCamp. I also started laying down the foundation for the random quote generator project.

### Day 3: January 11, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I continued to work on the random quote generator project. I watched a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJesac0_Ftw) on JSON and AJAX, which was very helpful. I was able to implement the JS code to display a random quote from the array of JS objects.

**Thoughts:** I am happy with today's progress.
