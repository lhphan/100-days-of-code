# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 8, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I prepared the GitHub repo for the challenge.

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling nervous... I hope I'm able to complete the challenge.

### Day 1: January 9, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the JSON APIs and Ajax section of freeCodeCamp. I also started laying down the foundation for the random quote generator project.

**Thoughts:** I understand the basics of JSON but I'm still confused about how to implement APIs.

### Day 2: January 10, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I continued to work on the random quote generator project. I refreshed my memory of Javascript key object pairs by reading chapter 4 of Eloquent Javascript and watching some YouTube videos.

**Thoughts:** I still need to  refresh more of my Javascript knowledge.
